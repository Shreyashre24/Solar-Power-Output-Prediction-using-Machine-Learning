# Solar-Power-Output-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
"Built a Solar Power Forecasting model using weather data (temperature, irradiance, humidity, wind). Tested ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks, ARIMA). Achieved >99.99% accuracy (RÂ² ~0.9999) with Random Forest, outperforming baseline and classical time series methods."
